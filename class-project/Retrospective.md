#Class Project Retrospective

Douglas & Fir, LLC met as a team and discussed the class project, its successes, and its challenges. All members agreed that throughout all phases of the project the team excelled at evenly distributing the work load and keeping open lines of communication. We learned how to utilize Disciplined Agile Delivery and Scrum to structure and iterate over a software development lifecycle, how it is difficult to assign effort points to individual tasks, and brushed up on our LINQ skills. While there were no major breakdowns or failures to speak of over the course of the project, there were some challenges in understanding and practicing the chosen git workflow. Looking forward to the capstone project, we have as a team committed to taking greater care and consideration when assigning effort points to user stories and to being proactive about assisting one another in any git challenges that arise.
