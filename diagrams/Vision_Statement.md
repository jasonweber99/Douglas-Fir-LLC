# Vision Statement
### For visitors to Monmouth and Independence who want to learn more about or are planning to visit the area, the Monmouth-Independence Visitor Center Website is a hub of information that will allow visitors and people local to the area to keep updated on local events and attractions, find places to dine and stay overnight, discover outdoor recreation, and create detailed itineraries that include these items. A webstore will feature local merchandise available for purchase. This site will have logins for local business owners to add events and update informaiton about their businessesâ€”and an administrator login to control content on the site. Unlike the current Explore Polk County website, our website will be focused on Monmouth and Independence specifically and will have the ability to be easily updated by an administrator.
