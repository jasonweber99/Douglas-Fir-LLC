Sprint Retrospectives
=====================================

## Sprint 1 (02/09/21 - 02/22/21)

Our first sprint was a good learning experience for all team members and provided 
its fair share of curve balls and extenuating circumstances. Power and internet outages 
(some of which are still ongoing) made communication between team members difficult 
and stand-ups fewer in number and efficacy. 

Despite this, everyone feels as though the sprint was a success. We were pleased with 
the accuracy with which we were able to assign effort points to the user stories and 
their associated tasks we commited and felt like our understanding and ability to gauge 
this particular metric has grown considerably. 

## Sprint 2 (02/23/21 - 03/08/21)

This sprint saw the team reap some rewards from lessons learned and helped identify some 
additional opportunities for improvement in our process. We were pleased with the proper 
prioritization of the user stories that were taken on this sprint. The choices we made 
enabled us to effectively mitigate some of the potential challenges of working on a complex 
project with multiple developers. Additionally, the adoption of an earlier deadline for 
pull requests provided Jason with more time to devote to handling merge issues and deployment.

Moving forward, the team has made two commitments to further refine our team's funcitonality 
and collaborative capabilities. We've resolved to make ongoing and regular updates to our 
internal documentation and reference materials, and we will focusing on having more effective 
and consistent stand-ups in order to better stay abreast of everyone's progress and to 
provide more opportunities for collaboration as a whole.
