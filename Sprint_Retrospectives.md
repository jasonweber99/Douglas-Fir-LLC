Sprint Retrospectives
=====================================

## Sprint 1 (02/09/21 - 02/22/21)

Our first sprint was a good learning experience for all team members and provided 
its fair share of curve balls and extenuating circumstances. Power and internet outages 
(some of which are still ongoing) made communication between team members difficult 
and stand-ups fewer in number and efficacy. 

Despite this, everyone feels as though the sprint was a success. We were pleased with 
the accuracy with which we were able to assign effort points to the user stories and 
their associated tasks we commited and felt like our understanding and ability to gauge 
this particular metric has grown considerably.
