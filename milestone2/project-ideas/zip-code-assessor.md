# Zip Code Assessor Project Idea
## Questions
    * Short Explanation (John)


    * What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?) 
        This web app would go into much greater detail about each zip code than existing sites. Each zipcode could be compared with others in many different categories or be given a grade based on statistics that are important to the user. One related website is unitedstateszipcodes.org, which ranks zip codes by several categories, but there is no way to compare two zipcodes and there isnt an easy way to get zipcode statistics from a map view. Another similar website is niche.com, which also ranks cities/zipcodes in a limited number of categories and gives each neighborhood a grade ranking.


    * Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring? 
        This project would bring a ton of data together to allow the user to find out information about zip codes to determine a place to live, which school to attend, or to discover informaiton about the user's current location. The user could personalize the search and ranking based on the statistics that are important to them. 


    * What are a few major features? (John)


    * What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use. (Jason)


    * What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!) (John)


    * Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully. (Jason)
