# Milestone 2 - Vision Statement
For expeditionists who want to keep track of expeditions for various peaks, the  Himalayan Database is a website that allows expeditionists to add and view expeditions. The web application will allow users visiting to view expeditions added to the database. Any user can sign up for an account to add, edit their own blog posts and climb reports. Unlike the current Himalayan Database website, our product will allow expeditionists to have blog posts connected to their expeditions they add as well as have their account have a "verified" attribute if they are a prominent expeditionist.
